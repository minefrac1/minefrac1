- Hobbies: Programming, Reading, Gaming, Game Development, Food
- Currently developing a game with some friends
- If you need to reach me, email minefrac1@gmail.com
- If you really care that much about my pronouns, they're he/him
- Favorite color: blue
- Favorite game series: It's too hard to pick!
- Dogs or cats: 🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶
- Favorite emoji: 🛺
- Pet peeve: things you can *ONLY* do with commandline (it's a necessary evil...)
